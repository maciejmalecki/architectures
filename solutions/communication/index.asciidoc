= Communication

== Communication among services
Communication is a very important aspect while building IT application, especially large and complex one or one with microservices architecture. Based on your analysis of your problems, considering the following basic questions to start with:

* Which services have to communicate with which services? to exchange which type of data?
* How should the communication look like? in a synchronous way or asynchronous way?

Once you have your answers, make your choices on concrete protocols, products and libraries. Using multiple of them in your application is fine.

Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet. Each communication type has its own advantages and disadvantages and target a different scenario and goals. With that said, do not always apply REST or always apply message-driven approaches (e.g. Kafka) just because you have heard some success stories about it.

Here we try to expose cross-cutting best practices for communication among services in larger IT application landscapes on a high level. Details how to implement this with specific libraries or programming-languages are described in the individual stacks of devonfw.

== Communication types
Generally, types of communication can be classified in two axes.

image::communication-type.svg[Communication types]

The first axis defines if the protocol is synchronous or asynchronous:

    * *Synchronous protocol*: The client sends a request and waits for a response from the service as the client code can only continue its task when it receives the server response. That's independent of the client code execution that could be synchronous (thread is blocked) or asynchronous (thread isn't blocked, and the response will reach a callback eventually). e.g. HTTP/HTTPs
    * *Asynchronous protocol*: The client code or message sender usually doesn't wait for a response. It just sends the message as when sending a message to a queue or any other message broker. e.g AMQP

The second axis defines if the communication has a single receiver or multiple receivers:

    * *Single receiver*: Each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service.
    * *Multiple receivers*: Each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of communication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism.

One common style is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS when invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices also typically use messaging protocols for asynchronous communication between microservices. We will discuss more about some popular approaches adopted these days including:

    * <<rpc>>
    * <<messaging_and_eventing>>
    * <<service_mesh>>

[#rpc]
=== RPC
When it comes to RPC communication nowadays we immediately talk about HTTPS.

The most common choice is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST] with https://www.json.org/[JSON] that perfectly works together with web browsers.
However, please also consider other options especially for backend communication:

* https://grpc.io/[gRPC] is an efficient, high performance RPC protocol
* ...

Protocols like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP[SOAP] or even RMI, Corba, etc. should be considered as legacy and discouraged.

[#messaging_and_eventing]
=== Messaging and eventing

We do not even try to distinguish between _messaging_ and _eventing_.
A message can be seen as an event and an event as a message.
The nature of this communication style is that it is entirely asynchronous and the sender of the event or message does not have to know about the receipient(s).
There can even be many recipients for the same event or message.
Typically there is a central messaging system (event bus) that is all you need to know about to send and receive your events or messages.
This leads to a very loose coupling of your services.
While this adds flexibility it also can add quite some complexity to understand what is actually going on.
Debugging and tracing the communication can get really hard.
In the worst case you can lose control and end up with cyclic events triggering each other till eternity.
However, when properly applied, this communication style can make your architecture very powerful and extendable.

One of the most common choices for such a messaging system is https://kafka.apache.org[kafka]. Other message brokers to be considered are https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ] and https://activemq.apache.org/[ActiveMQ]

[#service_mesh]
=== Service mesh
In the context of microservices, service mesh is a key to communication.
Service-to-service communication is what makes microservices possible.
But creating, routing and managing this communication, both within and across application clusters, becomes increasingly complex as the number of services grows.
Service mesh solves this problem. It takes the logic governing service-to-service communication out of individual services and abstracts it to a layer of infrastructure.
It also captures every aspect of the communication as performance metrics which can be used to monitor the cluster as well as identify and analyze system failures if occurs.

One of the most common and best choices for service mesh is https://istio.io/latest/about/service-mesh/[istio].
Istio is an open-source service mesh with powerful features that enable developers to easily configure

    1. the traffic flow

    2. the authentication and authorization among internal and to external services and

    3. monitoring tools such as kiali, prometheus and grafana.

== Communication contracts

A communication contract is a structured document that defines the expected input and output of a service.

There are two approaches to using contracts for communications:

- *Contract first*: There is a design document that defines the formal contract of the communication and the code artefacts are derived with some tooling.
- *Code first*: Code is written directly and documentation is generated from there.

For enterprise development, contract first approach is preferred because it improves communication among involved development teams. These contracts can serve to develop tests, mocks and working code automatically and to enforce validation on both client and server sides of the services.

Contracts can be used both for synchronous or asynchronous communications, for example https://www.openapis.org/[Open Api] has become the standard for REST contracts and https://www.asyncapi.com/[Async Api] is growing in adoption for the asynchronous needs.
